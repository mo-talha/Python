# Python Notes
**print() function**
The print function can take in multiple strings and multiple data types at once and prints them separating with a space.
Ex: print(“talha”) → talha, print(“talha”, “yaseen”, “taha”), print(“talha”, 25, “yaseen”, 21, 44) all these are valid.

**The print function can take the following arguments:**
A separator: By default it's a space, but we can change this to anything of our choice like ‘-’, ‘/’ etc. ex: print(“talha”, 25,sep=‘:’) → this will print talha:25
end: we can define where the line should start after printing something, by default it is set to new line or ‘\n’
